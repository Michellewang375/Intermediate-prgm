I/O FILE
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
• using std::cerr; // default error output stream
• std::ofstream //fprintf, writing from a file
• std::ifstream //fscanf, reading from a file
• std::fstream // for reading and writing to/from a file
• std::stringstream //gives a stream associated w/ a string (can read and write from it)
        Instead of reading or writing to console or file, it reads and writes to a temporary string (“buffer”) stored inside
• str() function can be used to get the content of the buffer
    • str(string) sets the content of the buffer to the string. converts the stream at that point to strings
      #include <string>
      #include <iostream>
      #include <sstream>
      int main(){
          std::stringstream ss;
          ss << "Hello" << ' ' << 2019 << " world";
          std::cout << ss.str() << std::endl;
          std::string word1, word2; //word1 (hello), word2(world), num(2019)
          int num;
          ss >> word1 >> num >> word2;
          std::cout << word1 << ", " << word2 << " " << num << '!' << std::endl;
          return 0; } //Hello 2019 world (new line) Hello, world 2019!
• istringstream --> jsut reading stream
• ostringstream --> just writing stream





OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
• use classes to define new data type
• Special functions called constructors are used to initialize class objects
    (also called instances - variables declared to be of a class type)
• Special fuctions called destructors are used to perform clean-up operations just before the lifetime of a class instance ends
• We can use inheritance to define a class by extending an existing class (allowed to have multiple inheritance)

Inheritance: class A inherits from class B if every class A object “is-a” class B object also

  • everything inherit from input stream can use the extractor operator to print something or extract something from the input stream.
