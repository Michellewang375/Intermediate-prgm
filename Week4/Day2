POINTERS
• A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable.
• Every pointer points to a specific data type (except void)
• Declare a pointer using type of variable it will point to, and a *
      • int *p; variable p w/ address of int 
• Operations related to pointers
      • address-of operator (&): returns address of whatever follows it
      • dereferencing operator (*): returns value being pointed to
            int x = 1;
            int y = 2;
            int *ip; /* declare ip, points ip to int */
            ip = &x; /* ip now "points to" x */ (val of 1)
            y = *ip; /* y is now 1 */
            *ip = 0; /* x is now 0 */
• More egs:
    • *ip = *ip + 10 //whatever ip is pointing to, inc its val by 10
    • y = *ip + 1 //take whatever ip is pointing to, inc it by 1, the assign it to y
