MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS
Declaring: <base_type> <name>[dim1_sz][dim2_sz][dim3_sz];
• Array elements are stored in row-major order
• all of row1 comes first, then all of row2
    int a[row_size][col_size];
    int table[2][4] = { {1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8} }; //[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
    table[i][j] // refers to jth element in ith row of 2D array
• First array size need not be specified in formal parameter, but second and following dimensions must be given
    void sum_matrix(int list[][4], int numRows);


GDB
• a GNU debugger (-g)
• to run debugger program: gdb ./file_name(w/o .c)
• After running a command, gdb prints out the next line of code in the program
• gdb commands:
    break function_name - stops program at beginning of function in order to debug function line by line
    run - start the program,  immediately pauses at top of function_name
    next - executes the statement on the current line and moves onto the next. doesnt pause at function calls
    step - begins to execute the statement on the current line. If function call, it steps into the function and pauses there, or else behaves like next
    list - show current code block
