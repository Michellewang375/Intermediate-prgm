OO DESIGN AND UML
• When are objects in a problem definition are related by inheritance?
    • If you can say “every A is a B”
      • B could be a base class (superclass, parent)
      • A would be a derived class (subclass, child)
      • class A inherits from class B (like A contained within B)
    • "is-a" relationship
        • eg: Every cat is a mammal; Every desk is furniture

• When are objects in a problem definition are related by composition?
    • If you can say “every A has a B”
      • A would be the containing class
      • B would be the contained class
      • class A is partially composed from class B
    • "has-a" relationship
        • eg: Every desk has a chair; Every clinic has employees
  • Aggregation is like composition, but for collections of objects of another class type




UML (Unified Modeling Language)
• helps visualize relationships:
    • class names go in rectangles
    • triangle arrow goes from derived class (A) to base class (B) (inheritance -->)
        • class A — IS-A —> class B
    • diamond arrows at a containing class (A) goes to the contained class (B) (composition --<>)
        • class A <>— HAS-A — class B
