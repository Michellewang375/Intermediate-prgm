ITERATORS
linked list of ints
//.h
#include <iostream>
class ListNode {
    public: // private: //usually private but public for this example
    ListNode(int val, ListNode *nxt) : data(val), next(nxt) {}
    int data;
    ListNode *next; }

//in .cpp
//Run through all items in list, output them one by one
for (ListNode* cur = &l1; cur != nullptr; cur = cur->next) { std::cout << cur->data << " "; }

• Code to “run through all elements” looks very different (cur pointer that advances through linked list vs. for loop over integer indices of vector)
• C++ iterators unify these different code segments
• Regardless of the container specifics, an iterator feels like a pointer to successive individual elements, that we can easily advance

Different iterators
• iterator - over a container to traverse elements in the container in order from beginning to end
reverse_iterator - can be used to traverse elements in a backwards direction
const_iterator - is an iterator which promises not to modify individual elements as it progresses through them

Defining our own iterators
• can write iterator as a nested class inside container class
    • A nested class sits inside another class definition, and has access to the members of the enclosing class, including private members
    • for (MyContainerType::iterator it = c.begin(); it != c.end(); ++it) {std::cout << *it << " "; }
