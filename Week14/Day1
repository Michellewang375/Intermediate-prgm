FUNCTORS
• able to pass functionality (C through function ptrs, c++ through memeber function objects --> through overloading and templates)
• an object that acts like a function by defining the function call operator – operator()
    • need them to support paramterized functions

LAMBDAS
• functors that are defined on-the-fly
• keywords: []( arg1, arg2 ){ return something; } //multiple returns should be of same type
    • []( int i1 , int i2 ){ return i1<i2; }
• The contents within the brackets describe what is captured – which local variables the body of the function has access to, and whether the access is by value or by reference.
    • empty - nothing is captured.
    • A comma-separated list enumerates the variables captured
    • With a “&” prefix means “captured by reference”
    • Without a “&” prefix means “captured by value”
    • Just a “&” inside the brackets means “all variables are captured by reference”

AUTO 
• auto keyword - compiler determines the variable's type based on its initializer expression
    auto sort_lambda = []( int i1 , int i2 ){ return i1<i2; };
    //in iterators
    auto it=c.cbegin()
    auto it=v.begin()
