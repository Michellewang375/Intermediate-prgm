CLASSES
• Class defintion: blueprint defining a type
• Objects of that type are created from that blueprint
• Once a class is defined, it can create objects
• Each of the objects is an instance of the class and has its own copies of all instance variables
    class Rectangle {
        public:
        double width;
        double height;
        void print() const {
            cout << "width=" << width << ", height=" << height << endl; }
        double area() const {
            return width * height; }
    int main() {
        Rectangle r = {30.0, 40.0};
        r.print();
        cout << "area=" << r.area() << endl;
        return 0; }
• Basic principles:
    • using const means that function will not modify any member fields
    • Class definition goes in a .h file
    • Functions can be declared and defined inside class { ... };
        • “in-lining” the function definition: Only define member function inside the class definition if it’s very short
        • Otherwise, put a prototype in the class definition and define the member function in a .cpp file
    • you’ll need to qualify the function with the class scope such as Classname::function() { } in the .cpp file
Option 1
    #ifndef RECTANGLE_H
    #define RECTANGLE_H
    class Rectangle {
        double area() const {
        // short definition inside class
        return width * height;
        } };
    #endif
Option 2
  //In Rectangle.h:
    #ifndef RECTANGLE_H
    #define RECTANGLE_H
    class Rectangle {
      double area() const;
    };
    #endif
  //In Rectangle.cpp:
    #include "Rectangle.h"
        double Rectangle::area() const { // def'n outside class
    return width * height; }
• fields are private by default, but can be public (public: ), private (private: ), or protected
    • public: can be accessed freely by any code with access to the class definition (includes .h)
    • private: can be accessed from other member functions in the class, but not by a user of the class (cant change it outside the implementation of that member functions of that class)
• fields shouldnt be initalized, unless they r static 
    class Rectangle {
    public:
      double area() const {
      return width * height; }
    private:
      double width, height; }; //only accessible when class is implemented






DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR
• Default constructor for a class: a member function that is called when you declare a new variable of that class without any initialization
    int main() {
       Rectangle r; } // behind the scenes, Rectangle's default constructor is called
• Constructor: a member function you can define yourself (should be public)
    • Function name must match the class name exactly
    class Rectangle {
    public:
    // default constructor for Rectangle
      Rectangle() { ... }
      ... }
• Compiler-generated default constructor does: 
    • Built-in types (int, doubles,. . . ), instance variables aren’t initialized (so they have garbage values)
    • For instance variables of class types, default constructor for that class type is called
• A constructor is called implicitly when a new object is declared or explicitly when one is created using new.
    int main() {
      // calls default constructor for r
      Rectangle r;
      // calls default constructor for *rp
      Rectangle *rp = new Rectangle(); }
• creating own constructor: the compiler won’t generate any constructor for us
    class Rectangle {
    public:
    //defining own constructor - intlaizer list
      Rectangle() : width(0.0), height(0.0) { }
    private:
      double width, height; };
